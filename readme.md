### Corax engine
The Corax engine is a 2d adventure side scroller video game engine. It work with a strict cordinate system based on a grid. The sprites movements are locked on that grid. All the event systems, hitboxes system and animation data are following that grid. However the grid size can be set by project.
- Currently built over PyGame2 framework
- 2d Hand drawed animation oriented
- Gameplay strictly locked on a grid, e.i. Prince of Persia

### Crackle script
Game story scripting is using the engine langage: crackle.  Very basic langage which allow to script action under multiple condition:
```
script go_to_tente_with_sword // script definition
    key UP is pressed // first indent are the conditions
    scene is forest_01 // "and" operator is the one used implicitly
    player whitecrow: movesheet is whitecrowparrot_sword.json
    player whitecrow: animation is idle
    player whitecrow: hitbox foot in zone tente
        player whitecrow: play tidy_up_sword // second indent are actions executed
        run go_to_tente // is all conditions are true
```
